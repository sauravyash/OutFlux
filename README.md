# OutFlux

##About
--
OutFlux is a torrent based music streaming/playing client similar to PopcornTIme for movies. I just started the project and feel free to do a pull request if you want. I am starting the project in xcode (for macOS and iOS), but you can contribute or help by adding other distros like android, Linux or windows.
