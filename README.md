# OutFlux (alpha)

**OutFlux** is a torrent based music streaming/playing client similar to PopcornTime for movies, created in Electron. I just started the project and feel free to do a pull request if you want. I am starting the project in xcode (for macOS and iOS), but you can contribute or help by adding other distros like android, Linux or windows.

## To Do
- Design UI
- Add torrenting backend
- Add Music Player
- a whole lot of other things
